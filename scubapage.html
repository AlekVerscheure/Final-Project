    <br>

    A sport most people will never experience in their lifetime, one I do regularly. Scuba or Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus, is a sport my father and I will enjoy together annually. I got certified when I was 12 years old and now will go down to Cancun and go diving with my dad, who is also certified. Down in Cancun, I had my first ever open water dive in what they called an "Underwater Museum." This Museum consisted of things like small houses for nearby fish, fake mines, hundreds of statues, and most amazing of all, a Volkswagon Bug, sitting at the bottom of the ocean. All these things were intentionally placed in this area to give nearby fish some shelter as there were no coral reefs within miles. It was truly an amazing experience. <br><br>

    <u> Downtown Scuba</u>  <br><br>   <!--Section Heading-->
       

       I have also gone diving in the Denver Downtown Aquarium with my father. There is an exhibit that has a tunnel where visitors can walk underneath the exhibit in the tunnel. I went diving in that exhibit and got to high five all the visitors through the glass. We got to stay down there for about 45 minutes and the aquarium had a scheduled mermaid show in the same exhibit we were diving in. We didn't have enough time to leave the water before they entered. So all of us divers just got to go off to the side and watch the mermaid show while still being underwater.
