 <!--Intro to my about me page--> 

   <h4 class = "aboutme">I am Alek Verscheure, athlete and student at MVHS. I may be young, but I have done many things in my life that some people may never experience in their entire lifetime. I love the outdoors and participate in activities such as skiing, scuba diving, hockey, kayaking, paddle boarding, and jet skiing. <br> <br>

  <u> Skiing </u> <br><br>  <!--Section Heading--> 

   I will often take part in shredding some fresh powder on the slopes. I have been skiing since I was three years old. Both of my parents ski, and always make sure to get out on the mountain nearly every weekend. We will normally go to Arapahoe-Basin (A-Basin) or Keystone if we are looking for some good snow conditions and short lines. Getting to zoom down the snowy mountain at nearly 40 mph and hitting those jumps is an experience of a lifetime. <br><br>

  <u>  Paddle Boarding </u> <br><br>  <!--Section Heading-->

    Paddle boarding is another one of the outdoor activities I like to do during the summer. Up in the mountains during the summer when it is nice outside, I will go paddle boarding with my mom on Lake Dillon. She has a rather bad back as she injured it in a skiing collison a few years back, so she doesn't like to sit and paddle, so we decided to start paddle boarding. This sport is fun as it combines paddling around a pond or lake, and needing to develop good balancing skills in order to stay up on the board.
